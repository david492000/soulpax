                Forged from the mold of classic Blues and R&B has emerged a group who seamlessly fuses past with present in a way that none have done before. Through his meticulous study of acts such as T-Bone Walker, Otis Rush, and Jimmy Dawkins, guitarist/writer Julian Harris has molded his own natural abilities: casting them in a modern interpretation of these titans of the Blues.

                Taking inspiration from the classic songwriting styles of Joni Mitchell, Otis Redding, and James Brown, to name a few, singer/songwriter Julia Camayd has worked tirelessly to hone her skills as a musician and lyricist. As a vocalist, she trained for years in the classical and chorale traditions, which she brings to bear on her modern interpretations of Gospel, Blues, Swing, Folk Rock, R&B, Jazz improv, and other modalities, with a Billy Holiday attitude and echoes of Janis Joplin, and yet uniquely herself.

                Through their combined songwriting talents and abilities Julian and Julia have teamed up to create a band that not only pays homage to those who have come before but strives to frame the standard for contemporary R&B.</p>

                  From the very beginning, Julia Camayd felt a clear, strong pull to the many
                  wonders of music; humming before she could form proper sentences and telling
                  every inquiring adult who asked that she wanted to grow up to be an artist. The
                  ambition-filled path she would walk made itself evident to her, beginning with her
                  first influences: Christina Aguilera, Nsync, and of course Nat King Cole. From
                  then on, Camayd committed herself to one day being an insurmountable paragon
                  of influence on the world of song.</p>
                  <p align="left">While growing up in the culturally rich experience of Miami, FL, Julia was
                  eager to join her elementary school choir and by 2003, she began to learn the
                  fundamentals of music by performing with the Miami Children’s Chorus, to which
                  she would dedicate 5 years. The MCC granted Camayd the honor of being part
                  of many extraordinary concerts, including the Miami premier of Carmina Burana
                  and the opening of the Adrienne Arsht Center with Gloria Estefan. Julia’s thirst
                  for art and culture would continue to manifest itself through her singing, but she
                  soon discovered a vehement passion for songwriting in 2006 under her middle
                  school music teacher, Joel Nunes. From time with the notebook and guitar, to
                  leading supportive friends in playing some of her first originals, Camayd found a
                  vital vehicle of emotion through poetry and sound. Soon she found herself
                  humbled, surrounded by flourishing young artists at New World School of the
                  Arts, where she studied classical soloist technique and vocal performance.
                  Around this time, Camayd derived inspiration from genres including Jazz,
                  acoustic music, post punk alternative, among others, and joined her first band,
                  Flashbang, which became well known by some high schools in her
                  neighborhood. As her teenage years slowly wound down to an end, Julia came
                  across young jazz guitarist and kindred spirit, Julian Harris. In sharing the
                  magical experience of co-writing music, the friends began playing together in
                    Flashbang and as an acoustic duo, Julian and Julia.</p>

                <p align="left">Camayd and Harris continued to challenge one another to be better
                  composers and instrumentalists, so they embarked on a pilgrimage to Camayd’s
                  birthplace, Boston, MA. to attend the world-renowned Berklee College of Music.
                  Under the instruction of names such as Livingston Taylor, Paula Gallitano,
                  Bonnie Hayes, and many more, Camayd made strides to develop a well-rounded
                  musicality. Camayd’s Dylan-poetic sensibility and fiery Joplin musical spirit,
                  along with Harris’ virtuoso Stevie Ray Vaughn style and Blues influence, formed
                  the pinnacle of their partnership: Soulpax. Since then, Julia has buckled down as
                  the co-leader of this band, arranging out of state tours, organizing radio
                  interviews, and writing songs that speak to the human experience, with effort to
                  lyricize ideas in ways never thought of before. Soulpax has played with names
                  like Robert Randolph and the Family Band, Kat Wright and the Indomitable Soul
                  Band, and the Marshal Tucker Band. Today, Camayd is eager to share her
                  knowledge with her many singing and songwriting students and is persistent in
                    her tenacity to make a mark on the world of music and a name for Soulpax.</p>

                  From a young age Julian Harris has been drawn the passionate fire of music. In
                  the early days, attending services from his Synagogue, Julian became enthralled by the
                  sounds he heard billowing out from the loud speakers and across the isles. These sonic
                  vibrations would memorize, captivate, and drive him to pick up the one instrument he
                  needed to define his life, the guitar. From then on there was no looking back.</p>
                <p align="left">Julian was always drawn to the sounds and artistry of music. It became a
                  necessity for him to be apart of his middle school jazz band. A combination of drive and
                  dedication dictated the importance of playing music at any opportunity he got. From then
                  on he would continue his study music playing in various bands, weather in school or
                  recreational, eventually leading him to an early look at what it meant to be a working
                  musician. While he was in high school Julian would accomplish such feats as getting to
                  play a show with Tito Puente Jr. and opening up for the world renown group, Blue Oyster
                  Cult. During this period of musical activity Julian would across a young songwriter by
                  the name of Julia Camayd. These two entered into a world of creation that they had not
                  yet been exposed to. From then on these two would become inseparable, writing songs at
                  any chance they could grasp. The two would go on to attend one of the worlds most
                  prestigious music schools, Berklee College of Music. It was here that Julian and Julia
                  would hone their skills as instrumentalists and songwriters. These crucial years gave birth
                  to the greatest project that these two would become apart of, Soulpax. Times were trying
                  but not discouraging as Julian forged out a name for himself as co-band leader along with
                  his partner Julia. In this he would get down to the grind stone and learn what it truly
                  meant to write for a band, organize rehearsals, book shows, and all else that is required in
                  order to bring his dream of running a successful band out from the basement onto the
                  stage.</p>

                <p align="left">Today Julian works diligently along side his partner, Julia, in order to bring
                  success and acclaim to their band, Soulpax. Neither high water nor brimstone will stand
                  in the way of achieving his dream of carving out a name in history for himself and for
                  Soulpax.</p>
